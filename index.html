        <h3>About Mercy</h3>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors in Biology. I really enjoyed learning how the different compartments of the body work together to allow the human body to function. Since graduating, I have expanded that fascination with how things work to bring decor together to form cohesive designs for events and to bring different notes together to form music. I am now expanding this creative side into the world of software development. It excites me to use the different components of the technology world and use them together to create the seamless web experiences we interact with on a daily basis. In particular, I enjoyed putting together my personal website where you are able to navigate and get to what you need easily. </p>
        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com/getstarted/employer-partnerships/#outcomes" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I have started my journey that dives into the technical details of how web develpoment works.If you're looking to hire a new developer, or if you would like to collaborate together, please reach out! I am so thrilled to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
